### üìÅ **Projects**

Here you find some projects which I encountered during my graduation or work. All code is created by me. The data used is usually well-known data in the field and DOES NOT contain information of anyone who I worked for. Feel free to have a look.

#### üéì [Whiteboxing a Neural Network in PyTorch with Captum](https://github.com/fishingpvalues/whitebox-pytorch-captum)
- **Description:** We use Captum to describe the classification decisions of a neural network. The crux here was enabling multiclass classification comparison, which wasn't possible with the vanilla framework.  
- **Role:** Working student  
- **Tools/Technologies Used:** Python, PyTorch, Captum  
- **Outcomes:** Several neurons shared a strong association with certain outcomes.
