### 📁 **Projects & Research**

Here you can find some of my projects and research contributions.

#### 🛠 [Explaining Neural Networks with Captum](https://github.com/fishingpvalues/whitebox-pytorch-captum)
- **Description:** A PyTorch-based implementation for interpreting neural network predictions using Captum.
- **Key Features:**
  - Uses **Integrated Gradients**, **SHAP**, and **Feature Attribution** to explain model decisions.
  - Custom implementation to enable **multiclass classification** explainability, overcoming Captum's default limitations.
  - Example notebooks showcasing how to analyze different architectures.
- **Technologies Used:** Python, PyTorch, Captum  
- **How to Use:** Clone the repo and run the notebooks to visualize explanations.

#### 📜 [Scientific Papers Repository](https://github.com/fishingpvalues/papers)
- **Description:** A collection of my academic contributions, including research on explainability in reinforcement learning and digital twins.
- **Current Papers:**
  - **Demystifying Reinforcement Learning - SHAP and Captum**
  - **Learning Simulation-based Digital Twins for Discrete Material Flow Systems**
